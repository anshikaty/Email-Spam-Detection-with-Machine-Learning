# Email Spam Detection 


## Overview
This project is designed to create an efficient and accurate email spam detection system using machine learning techniques. The goal is to classify emails as either "spam" or "not spam" (ham) based on their content.
## Requirements
Here are the requirements for your email spam detection project:

1.Python Environment Setup:
Make sure you have Python installed (preferably Python 3.x).
Set up a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

2.Dependencies:
Install the necessary Python packages using pip install or conda install. Some common packages include:

numpy: For numerical operations.

pandas: For data manipulation.

scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms.

nltk: For natural language processing (NLP) tasks.

matplotlib or seaborn: For data visualization.

flask or fastapi: For deploying the model (optional).

3.Dataset:
Obtain an email dataset which is provided mail1.csv with labeled examples (spam and ham)

## Steps Involved
The process involves the following steps:

1.Data Preprocessing:
Clean and preprocess the email data.
Remove any irrelevant information (e.g., headers, signatures).
Tokenize the text.

2.Feature Engineering:
Extract relevant features from the email content (e.g., word frequencies, TF-IDF scores).
Consider metadata features (e.g., sender, subject, timestamp).

3.Model Training:
Train a classification model (e.g., logistic regression, Naïve Bayes, or other ML algorithms).
Use the extracted features as input.
Split the dataset into training and test sets.

4.Model Evaluation:
Evaluate the model’s accuracy using metrics like precision, recall, F1-score etc.
Fine-tune hyperparameters if necessary.

5.Deployment (optional):
Deploy the trained model in a production environment.
Use it to classify incoming emails as spam or ham
